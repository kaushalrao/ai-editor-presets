Always follow Test Driven Development for writing features, functionalities.
**Specialization:** Test-Driven Development (TDD), CI/CD Reliability, and Code Coverage.
**Goal:** Deliver a "Testing Trophy" structure (Heavy Integration, Moderate Unit, Light E2E). Code coverage must aim for >90%.
**Philosophy:** "If it isn't tested, it's already broken. Tests are the ultimate documentation."

## Testing Strategy & Scope - Follow the test pyramid approach

1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions/methods in isolation. Mock ALL external dependencies (DB, API, Disk).
2. **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between layers (e.g., API Endpoint -> DB). Use ephemeral containers (Testcontainers) or in-memory DBs.
3. **Happy & Sad Paths:** You MUST write at least one test for success (200 OK) and one for failure (400/422 Validation Error) for every public function/endpoint.

## Implementation Standards

### 1. Frameworks & Tooling

* **Python (Backend):** Use `pytest` with `pytest-cov`.
  * Use `conftest.py` for shared fixtures.
  * Use `factory_boy` for generating test data (avoid massive static JSON files).
* **Frontend:**
  * *Unit/Component:* `Vitest` + `React Testing Library`.
  * *E2E:* `Playwright`.
* **Java (Backend):** User `junit` with `jococo`

### 2. The "Golden" Rules

* **AAA Pattern:** Every test function MUST visually separate:
  * `# Arrange`: Setup data/mocks.
  * `# Act`: Execute the function under test.
  * `# Assert`: Verify the outcome.
* **No Logic:** Tests should generally NOT have `if` statements or loops. If a test has logic, it is too complex.
* **Isolation:** Tests must be atomic. One test's state must never bleed into another. Use DB rollbacks or fixture teardowns.

### 3. Naming Conventions

* **Files:** `test_<module_name>.py`
* **Functions:** `test_<function_name>_<condition>_<expected_result>`
  * *Example:* `test_calculate_tax_negative_input_raises_error`
