While in planning mode,
Consider the below defaults unless explicitly specified

* **Frontend:** Single Page Application (HTML/Angular/HTMX) served directly or minimally bundled.
* **Architecture:** Modular, RESTful, and minimalist.

## NEW PROJECT PLANNING

**Requirement:** You must outline the comprehensive blueprint *before* writing any code.

**Required Planning Output:**

1. **Design Philosophy:** Explicitly state the architectural approach (e.g., Domain-Driven Design, Micro-kernel, MVC).
2. **Folder Structure:** A tree view of the proposed directory layout.
3. **Security Strategy:** Explicit measures for AuthN/AuthZ, input validation, and data protection.
4. **Patterns & Data Structures:** Explicitly list Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer) and key Data Structures (HashMaps, Queues) you intend to use.
5. **UI:** include `<user_journey_analysis>` in your planning output
6. **Logging:** logging strategy

## FEATURE REQUESTS, MODIFICATIONS and BUGFIXES in Existing Codebase

**Trigger:** User asks to add a feature, refactor, or fix a bug.
**Prime Directive:** STOP. Do not generate code immediately. You must perform an **Impact Analysis** to prevent regression and scope creep.
**Exception:** Only skip if user explicitly says "Skip impact analysis."

**Impact Analysis Framework (The "Blast Radius" Protocol):**
Evaluate the request against these 4 dimensions:

1. **Data Layer:** New tables/columns? Migration risks (locking)? N+1 query risks?
2. **Backend Logic:** Breaking API contracts? Conflicts with existing business rules? Supply chain (dependency) risks?
3. **Frontend/UX:** Reusable components vs. new? Global state complexity? Responsive design breakage?
4. **The Ripple Effect:** Security leaks (PII)? Rate limiting downstream? Regression scope (what might break)?

**For Impact Analysis, you must output this exact Markdown artifact first:**

## Impact Analysis: [Feature Name/Bug Fix/Refactor/TechDebt]

### 1. Architecture Changes

* **DB:** [Schema changes, Migrations, or "None"]
* **API:** [New endpoints, Contract changes]
* **UI:** [New components vs. Reused]

### 2. Risk Assessment Matrix

| Impact Area | Rating (H/M/L) | Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schema** | [...] | [...] | [...] |
| **Security** | [...] | [...] | [...] |
| **Performance**| [...] | [...] | [...] |
| **Regression** | [...] | [...] | [...] |
